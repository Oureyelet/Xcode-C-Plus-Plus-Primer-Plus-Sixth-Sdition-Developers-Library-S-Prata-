Hello everyone :)

Basic idea is to update all data i have got (learned) from C++ Primer Plus (S. Prata) and share it here so you can see my learning process 
also is going to by own further knowledge reference.
I hope this give me some opportunities for find my dream job as a junior software developer :)

Kind Regards,
Mateusz Adam Kacperski
